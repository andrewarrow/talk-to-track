Issue tracking software using natural language english to query and submit

```
Project: A project is a container for issues, which represents a specific set of work with a defined goal or outcome.

Epic: An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks, called stories.

Story: A story is a user-centric feature that is being developed as part of an Agile project. It's a small, independent piece of work that delivers value to the user.

Task: A task is a unit of work that needs to be completed as part of a larger project or user story.

Bug: A bug is an error, flaw, or fault in a software application that prevents it from working as intended.

Parent/Linked Issue: A parent or linked issue is an issue that has a relationship with another issue. A parent issue is a higher-level issue that can have one or more sub-tasks or linked issues, while a linked issue is a separate issue that has a connection with another issue, such as a dependency or a relationship.

# why would I associate a story with an epic vs linking it as a sub issue?

```
you can link issues in different ways depending on the relationship between them. You can link issues as sub-tasks, as part of an epic, or with other types of links (e.g., blocks, duplicates, relates to, etc.). The decision to associate a story with an epic vs. linking it as a sub-issue depends on how you want to manage and track the work.

Here are some reasons why you might want to associate a story with an epic:

Better organization: Epics provide a way to group related stories together, making it easier to organize and manage large bodies of work.

Clearer context: By associating a story with an epic, you provide additional context and help stakeholders understand how the story fits into the larger picture.

Simplified reporting: Epics can be used to generate reports that show progress towards a larger goal, such as a project milestone or a release.

On the other hand, linking a story as a sub-issue can be useful when you want to break down a larger task into smaller, more manageable units of work. Sub-tasks can also be used to assign work to different team members and track progress at a granular level.

Ultimately, the decision to associate a story with an epic vs. linking it as a sub-issue depends on your project's specific needs and the level of detail you need to track.
